# From equations of state to gravitational wave spectra
Mika MÃ¤ki, Doctoral Researcher, Computational Field Theory group, University of Helsinki

The
[Sound Shell Model](https://doi.org/10.1088/1475-7516/2019/12/062)
provides a computationally efficient way of calculating
the gravitational wave spectra of cosmological first-order phase transitions.
Based on the Sound Shell Model, we have created the simulation framework
[PTtools](https://github.com/CFT-HY/pttools)
and integrated it with our web-based plotting utility
[PTPlot](https://www.ptplot.org/).

In this talk I will show how to use PTtools and PTPlot
to easily compute Sound Shell Model power spectra for
[arbitrary equations of state](http://hdl.handle.net/10138/591514).
This is crucial to improving the quality of predictions
of stochastic backgrounds of gravitational waves from phase transitions,
including equations of state beyond the bag model with temperature- and phase-dependent sound speeds.
